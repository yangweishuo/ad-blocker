Other functions determine whether a particular Node-API version can be built and can issue console warnings for unsupported Node-API versions.\n\nUnlike the modules this code is designed to facilitate building, this module is written entirely in JavaScript.\n\n## Quick start\n\n```bash\nnpm install napi-build-utils\n```\n\nThe module exports a set of functions documented [here](./index.md). For example:\n\n```javascript\nvar napiBuildUtils = require('napi-build-utils');\nvar napiVersion = napiBuildUtils.getNapiVersion(); // Node-API version supported by Node, or undefined.\n```\n\n## Declaring supported Node-API versions\n\nNative modules that are designed to work with [Node-API](https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html#n_api_n_api) must explicitly declare the Node-API version(s) against which they are coded to build. This is accomplished by including a `binary.napi_versions` property in the module's `package.json` file. For example:\n\n```json\n\"binary\": {\n  \"napi_versions\": [2,3]\n}\n```\n\nIn the absence of a need to compile against a specific Node-API version, the value `3` is a good choice as this is the Node-API version that was supported when Node-API left experimental status.\n\nModules that are built against a specific Node-API version will continue to operate indefinitely, even as later versions of Node-API are introduced.\n\n## History\n\n**v2.0.0** This version was introduced to address a limitation when the Node-API version reached `10` in NodeJS `v23.6.0`. There was no change in the API, but a SemVer bump to `2.0.0` was made out of an abundance of caution.\n\n## Support\n\nIf you run into problems or limitations, please file an issue and we'll take a look. Pull requests are also welcome.\n","time":{"created":"2022-01-26T13:57:43.165Z","modified":"2025-01-17T03:08:20.821Z","1.0.2":"2020-03-05T22:43:13.884Z","1.0.1":"2018-09-12T23:55:07.569Z","1.0.0":"2018-09-12T23:11:05.603Z","2.0.0":"2025-01-17T03:07:01.150Z"},"versions":{"1.0.2":{"name":"napi-build-utils","version":"1.0.2","description":"A set of utilities to assist developers of tools that build N-API native add-ons","main":"index.js","scripts":{"doc":"jsdoc2md index.js >index.md","test":"mocha test/ && npm run lint","lint":"standard","prepublishOnly":"npm run test && npm run doc"},"keywords":["n-api","prebuild","prebuild-install"],"author":{"name":"Jim Schlight"},"license":"MIT","homepage":"https://github.com/inspiredware/napi-build-utils#readme","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/inspiredware/napi-build-utils.git"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/inspiredware/napi-build-utils/issues"},"devDependencies":{"chai":"^4.1.2","jsdoc-to-markdown":"^4.0.1","mocha":"^5.2.0","standard":"^12.0.1"},"binary":{"note":"napi-build-tools is not an N-API module.
