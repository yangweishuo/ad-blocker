Eg. [`CSSselect`](https://github.com/fb55/CSSselect) uses these functions to determine whether a selector won't match any elements. If that's the case, the DOM doesn't even have to be touched.\n\n###And why is this a separate module?\n\nI'm trying to modularize `CSSselect` and most modules depend on these functions. IMHO, having a separate module is the easiest solution to this problem.","time":{"created":"2022-01-26T20:57:18.665Z","modified":"2023-07-28T03:02:24.804Z","1.0.0":"2014-02-15T14:44:50.620Z"},"versions":{"1.0.0":{"name":"boolbase","version":"1.0.0","description":"two functions: One that returns true, one that returns false","main":"index.js","scripts":{"test":"echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/fb55/boolbase"},"keywords":["boolean","function"],"author":{"name":"Felix Boehm","email":"me@feedic.com"},"license":"ISC","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/fb55/boolbase/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/fb55/boolbase","_id":"boolbase@1.0.0","dist":{"shasum":"68dff5fbe60c51eb37725ea9e3ed310dcc1e776e","size":851,"noattachment":false,"tarball":"https://registry.npmmirror.com/boolbase/-/boolbase-1.0.0.tgz","integrity":"sha512-JZOSA7Mo9sNGB8+UjSgzdLtokWAky1zbztM3WRLCbZ70/3cTANmQmOdR7y2g+J0e2WXywy1yS468tY+IruqEww=="},"_from":".","_npmVersion":"1.4.2","_npmUser":{"name":"feedic","email":"me@feedic.com"},"maintainers":[{"name":"feedic","email":"me@feedic.com"}],"directories":{},"publish_time":1392475490620,"_hasShrinkwrap":false,"_cnpm_publish_time":1392475490620,"_cnpmcore_publish_time":"2021-12-16T14:17:27.781Z"}},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/fb55/boolbase/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/fb55/boolbase","keywords":["boolean","function"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/fb55/boolbase"},"_source_registry_name":"default"}
